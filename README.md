Machine learning project comparing regression models to predict Boston housing prices.
# Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involved developing and comparing multiple machine learning models to predict house prices based on the Boston housing dataset. The goal was to identify the most accurate model for this regression task.

## Methods Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, feature scaling
- **Feature Engineering:** Created polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented and compared:
  - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Model Evaluation:** Used R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics

## Results
- Random Forest model achieved approximately 15% lower MAE compared to baseline OLS
- Ridge regression showed improved generalization over OLS
- Feature importance analysis revealed key drivers of housing prices

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
